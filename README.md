# shell-scripting

This repository represents a compilation of useful shell scripts.

Slight tweaking may be necessary, as I run these back and forth on Mac
and Linux operating systems.  I did not code with portability in mind,
but the fact that they both use the bash shell makes this not-a-big-deal.

## How to run the scripts

Set permissions:

`chmod 755 script.sh`

Run it:

`.\script.sh`

or 

`sh script.sh`


### Details about specific scripts.

1. `sys.sh` is for generating a quick snapshot of your system.

`./sys.sh > sys.html`

Then go look at `sys.html` in a browser.
